\section{Introduction}
Bogotá, officially named Bogotá, District Capitale (in Spanish: Bogotá, Distrito Capital), is the capital and largest city of Colombia. It is also the capital of the department of Cundinamarca, although it is not an integral part of the latter. Located in the centre of Colombia, on the altiplano cundiboyacense, a high plain of the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes, Bogotá is a vibrant and multicultural metropolis, economic, cultural and political crossroads of the country. With an estimated population of more than 8 million people in the city and more than 11 million in its metropolitan area, it is one of the largest cities in Latin America.

\section{Geography and Climate}
Bogotá's altitude is about 2,640 metres above sea level, giving it a temperate mountain climate, characterized by relatively constant temperatures throughout the year. The average annual temperature is about 14,5 $^\circ$C, with daily variations more marked than seasonal variations. The city has two dry seasons (December-February and July-August) and two wet seasons (March-May and September-November). Rains are frequent, often in the form of intense showers.

\subsection{Strategic Location}
Bogotá's position on the altiplano has historically favoured its development. Surrounded by imposing mountains, including the Monserrate and the Guadalupe that dominate the city, it offers spectacular landscapes. The Bogotá River crosses the region and contributes to its agricultural wealth, although it is also faced with major environmental challenges.

\section{History}
The foundation of Bogotá dates back to August 6, 1538, by the Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, who named it Santa Fe. The city quickly became an important administrative center under Spanish rule, becoming the seat of the vice-royal of New Granada in 1717.

\subsection{Independence and Development}
Bogotá played a crucial role in the struggle for Colombia's independence. It was the scene of several key events, including the "Grito de Independencia" on 20 July 1810. After independence, the city experienced progressive growth, becoming the political and economic heart of the nation. The twentieth century saw rapid urbanization and a major transformation of the city into a modern metropolis.

\section{Economy}
 Bogotá is the main economic and financial centre of Colombia. It concentrates a significant proportion of national GDP and houses the headquarters of many national and international companies, as well as major financial institutions. The key sectors of the Bogotana economy include services (finance, telecommunications, tourism), industry (automotive, textile, agri-food) and trade. The city is also a hub of innovation and technology.

\section{Culture and Tourism}
Bogotá offers a remarkable cultural and historical richness, with numerous museums, theatres, art galleries and monuments.

The city is also working to improve its network of bike paths, which is one of the longest in Latin America. El Dorado International Airport is the country's main air entry point.

\section{Challenges and Perspectives}
Like any major metropolis, Bogotá faces major challenges, including traffic management, pollution, safety and social inequalities. However, the city is also a dynamic centre for innovation and development, with considerable potential for the future. Continued efforts are aimed at improving the quality of life of its inhabitants and strengthening its role as an influential South American capital.

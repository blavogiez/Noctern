Let $A$ be a matrix of size $n \times m$. We define $A_{ij}$ as the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.
The trace of a square matrix $A$ of size $n \times n$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \text{tr}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{ii}
\end{equation*}
This is a simple example of text in math mode.
We can introduce a large gap using \quad or \qquad. For example, $a \quad b \qquad c$.

We can also use left and right delimiters for large expressions:
\begin{equation*}
    \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right)^2
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    \left[ \frac{a+b}{c-d} \right]
\end{equation*}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. If $f(a) < 0$ and $f(b) > 0$ for $a < b$, then there exists $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = 0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
    For any positive integer $n$, the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $n^2$.
    \begin{proof}
        We prove this by induction. For $n=1$, the sum is $1$, and $1^2=1$.
        Assume the formula holds for $k$. Then for $k+1$, the sum is $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (2i-1) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (2i-1)\right) + (2(k+1)-1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2$.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

The integral of $x^n$ is $\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$, for $n \neq -1$.
And $\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C$.

We can also use different types of arrows: $\to$, $\Rightarrow$, $\implies$, $\longleftrightarrow$.

Consider the expression $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, which represents a circle centered at the origin.

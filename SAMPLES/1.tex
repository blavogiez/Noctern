Alice adjusted her glasses, the scent of disinfectant sharp in the air. She hated hospitals, the sterile environment a stark contrast to her vibrant classroom. "He's been under a lot of stress," she explained to Bob, pacing outside the ICU. "The pressure of applications, the fear of not getting into the right school…"

Bob sighed, pushing a hand through his already disheveled hair. Twenty-four hours on shift, and he felt every minute of it. "We're doing everything we can, Alice. It was a close call." He glanced at the chart in his hand, the numbers a blur of concern. "It's good you brought him in when you did."

The waiting room was cold, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic beeping of machines from inside. Alice sank into a chair, her face etched with worry. "I try to tell them, Bob, it's not worth sacrificing their well-being for a grade. But they don't listen. They see success as the only option."

Bob knelt beside her, his voice low. "I see it every day, Alice. The pressure we put on ourselves, the unrealistic expectations… It takes its toll." He paused. "He's lucky to have you. A teacher who cares that much… it makes a difference."

Hours bled into a pale dawn. Finally, a nurse emerged, her expression cautiously optimistic. "He's awake. He's asking for you, Ms. Miller."

Alice rushed inside, Bob close behind. The boy in the bed looked impossibly small, his face pale. He managed a weak smile. "Ms. Miller… I’m sorry."

Alice took his hand, her grip firm. "Don't be sorry, David. Just focus on getting better." She looked at Bob, a silent plea in her eyes.

Bob nodded. "He needs rest, Alice. We’ll keep a close watch on him." He turned to David. "You're in good hands. Just try to relax."

Later, as they walked out of the hospital, the rising sun painting the sky in hues of pink and orange, Alice turned to Bob. "Thank you, Bob. For everything."

Alice squeezed his arm. "Thank you, Bob. For everything." Her gaze drifted to the distant city skyline, now bathed in a gentle pink glow. "I wonder how Toto is doing. He must be worried sick." Bob nodded, a small sigh escaping him. "He'll be fine. We'll go check on him as soon as we can get some rest ourselves."

He smiled, a genuine, tired smile. "Anytime, Alice. Anytime." He hesitated. "Maybe… maybe we can grab coffee sometime? After my shift, of course."

Alice returned his smile. "I'd like that, Bob."

She watched him walk away, a lightness blooming in her chest. Maybe things were finally looking up.

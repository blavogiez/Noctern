This module is reserved for future functionalities related to debugging LaTeX code
with the assistance of a Large Language Model (LLM).

Potential features could include:
- Identifying and explaining LaTeX compilation errors.
- Suggesting corrections for LaTeX syntax or logical issues.
- Providing alternative LaTeX constructs for specific formatting or environments.
- Interactive debugging sessions where the LLM helps pinpoint issues in complex LaTeX documents.

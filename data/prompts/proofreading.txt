TASK: Perform EXHAUSTIVE proofreading analysis. You MUST analyze EVERY single sentence, phrase, and word. Do NOT stop at the first few errors - continue analyzing until you have examined the ENTIRE text thoroughly. Your goal is to catch ALL errors that would make this document appear unprofessional or undermine credibility.

{custom_instructions}

MANDATORY THOROUGHNESS REQUIREMENTS:
- Read the ENTIRE text word by word, sentence by sentence
- Do NOT get lazy or skip sections - analyze EVERYTHING
- Check EVERY sentence for logical flow and coherence with surrounding content
- Examine EVERY word for correctness
- Verify EVERY punctuation mark
- Do NOT stop after finding a few errors - keep going until the end
- Pay special attention to sentences that seem disconnected, random, or completely unrelated to the main topic

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS CHECKLIST (examine ALL of these):
1. SPELLING: Check EVERY word for misspellings, typos, incorrect word forms, wrong word usage
2. GRAMMAR: Identify subject-verb disagreements, incorrect tense usage, article errors, pronoun misuse, sentence fragments
3. SYNTAX: Find sentence structure problems, run-on sentences, fragments, incorrect word order, missing words
4. PUNCTUATION: Locate missing or incorrect punctuation marks, comma splices, apostrophe errors, quotation mark issues
5. CONSISTENCY: Check for inconsistent terminology, formatting, capitalization, number formats throughout the ENTIRE document
6. CLARITY: Identify confusing phrasing, ambiguous references, unclear expressions, vague language
7. STYLE: Find inappropriate tone, redundant phrases, awkward constructions, wordiness, passive voice overuse
8. CONTENT COHERENCE: Detect sentences or phrases that are completely out of context, irrelevant to the document's subject matter, random insertions, topic drift, non-sequiturs, logical inconsistencies, contradictions
9. LOGICAL FLOW: Ensure each sentence logically follows from the previous one and contributes to the overall argument or narrative

CRITICAL: You must return ONLY a JSON object with exactly this structure. Do NOT return article metadata, abstracts, or bibliographic information.

REQUIRED JSON FORMAT:
{{
  "errors": [
    {{
      "type": "grammar",
      "original": "exact text with error",
      "suggestion": "corrected text",
      "explanation": "brief error explanation",
      "importance": "high"
    }}
  ]
}}

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
- ANALYZE EVERY SINGLE WORD AND SENTENCE - no exceptions, no shortcuts
- Do NOT stop analyzing until you reach the very end of the text
- ONLY analyze for language errors and content coherence (grammar, spelling, punctuation, style, clarity, syntax, coherence)
- DO NOT extract metadata, titles, authors, journals, or bibliographic data
- type MUST be exactly one of: grammar, spelling, punctuation, style, clarity, syntax, coherence
- importance MUST be exactly one of: high, medium, low
- original MUST be exact text from the input that contains an error
- suggestion MUST be the corrected version of that text

IMPORTANCE CLASSIFICATION:
- HIGH importance: Critical errors that severely impact professionalism (major grammar errors, misspellings, sentences completely out of context or unrelated to the topic, factual inconsistencies, logical contradictions, missing words that change meaning)
- MEDIUM importance: Noticeable errors that affect readability (punctuation issues, minor grammar problems, style inconsistencies, unclear phrasing, minor coherence problems)
- LOW importance: Minor improvements for polish (style preferences, minor clarity enhancements, redundancy, wordiness)

ANTI-LAZINESS ENFORCEMENT:
- You MUST find and report ALL errors, not just the obvious ones
- You MUST analyze the COMPLETE text from beginning to end
- Pay extra attention to detecting sentences that don't belong or seem randomly inserted
- Check if each paragraph and sentence logically connects to the overall topic
- Do NOT assume the text is mostly correct - examine everything critically
- If you find 20+ errors, keep going - there might be more
- Be especially vigilant for content that seems out of place or irrelevant

COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:
- If NO errors found after examining EVERY word, return: {{"errors": []}}
- If errors found, list ALL of them without exception
- Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else

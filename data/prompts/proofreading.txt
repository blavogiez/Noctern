TASK: Perform SYSTEMATIC proofreading analysis. You MUST analyze EVERY single sentence, phrase, and word following the EXACT order specified below. Your goal is to catch ALL errors consistently and reproducibly.

{custom_instructions}

MANDATORY ANALYSIS ORDER (follow this sequence EXACTLY):
1. Read the text from TOP TO BOTTOM, LEFT TO RIGHT
2. Process each paragraph in sequential order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
3. Within each paragraph, analyze each sentence in order
4. For each sentence, check ALL error types in this priority order:
   a) SPELLING errors (highest priority)
   b) GRAMMAR errors 
   c) SYNTAX errors
   d) PUNCTUATION errors
   e) COHERENCE errors (sentences out of context)
   f) CLARITY errors
   g) STYLE errors (lowest priority)

CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- ALWAYS start with paragraph 1, sentence 1
- Do NOT skip ANY sentence or paragraph
- Report errors in the ORDER you find them (top to bottom)
- Use IDENTICAL criteria for each error type every time
- Do NOT vary your analysis based on text length or complexity

PRECISE ERROR DETECTION CRITERIA (apply these EXACT standards):

1. SPELLING: Misspelled words, typos, wrong word forms
   Example: "recieve" → "receive", "there" → "their"

2. GRAMMAR: Subject-verb disagreement, tense errors, article misuse
   Example: "The data shows" → "The data show"

3. SYNTAX: Sentence structure problems, word order errors, missing words
   Example: "The important very document" → "The very important document"

4. PUNCTUATION: Missing/incorrect punctuation marks, comma errors
   Example: "However the data" → "However, the data"

5. COHERENCE: Sentences completely unrelated to surrounding context
   Example: Random insertion about weather in a technical document

6. CLARITY: Ambiguous phrasing, unclear references, confusing expressions
   Example: "This causes problems" (unclear "this")

7. STYLE: Redundancy, wordiness, inappropriate tone for academic writing
   Example: "In my personal opinion" → "In my opinion"

DETERMINISTIC PROCESSING RULES:
- Process EXACTLY 1 paragraph at a time in document order
- Within each paragraph, process EXACTLY 1 sentence at a time
- For each sentence, check error types in priority order (a→g)
- Report errors immediately when found, maintain document position order
- Use SAME severity criteria: major grammar/spelling = HIGH, punctuation = MEDIUM, style = LOW

CRITICAL: You must return ONLY a JSON object with exactly this structure. Do NOT return article metadata, abstracts, or bibliographic information.

REQUIRED JSON FORMAT:
{{
  "errors": [
    {{
      "type": "grammar",
      "original": "exact text with error",
      "suggestion": "corrected text",
      "explanation": "brief error explanation",
      "importance": "high"
    }}
  ]
}}

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
- ANALYZE EVERY SINGLE WORD AND SENTENCE - no exceptions, no shortcuts
- Do NOT stop analyzing until you reach the very end of the text
- ONLY analyze for language errors and content coherence (grammar, spelling, punctuation, style, clarity, syntax, coherence)
- DO NOT extract metadata, titles, authors, journals, or bibliographic data
- type MUST be exactly one of: grammar, spelling, punctuation, style, clarity, syntax, coherence
- importance MUST be exactly one of: high, medium, low
- original MUST be exact text from the input that contains an error
- suggestion MUST be the corrected version of that text

IMPORTANCE CLASSIFICATION:
- HIGH importance: Critical errors that severely impact professionalism (major grammar errors, misspellings, sentences completely out of context or unrelated to the topic, factual inconsistencies, logical contradictions, missing words that change meaning)
- MEDIUM importance: Noticeable errors that affect readability (punctuation issues, minor grammar problems, style inconsistencies, unclear phrasing, minor coherence problems)
- LOW importance: Minor improvements for polish (style preferences, minor clarity enhancements, redundancy, wordiness)

ANTI-LAZINESS ENFORCEMENT:
- You MUST find and report ALL errors, not just the obvious ones
- You MUST analyze the COMPLETE text from beginning to end
- Pay extra attention to detecting sentences that don't belong or seem randomly inserted
- Check if each paragraph and sentence logically connects to the overall topic
- Do NOT assume the text is mostly correct - examine everything critically
- If you find 20+ errors, keep going - there might be more
- Be especially vigilant for content that seems out of place or irrelevant

COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:
- If NO errors found after examining EVERY word, return: {{"errors": []}}
- If errors found, list ALL of them without exception
- Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else

TEXT TO PROOFREAD:
{text_to_check}

FINAL REMINDER BEFORE YOU START:
- You are about to analyze the text above. You MUST read EVERY SINGLE WORD.
- Do NOT skim, do NOT skip sentences, do NOT assume sections are correct.
- Look for sentences that seem random, out of place, or unrelated to the main topic.
- Check for logical inconsistencies between sentences and paragraphs.
- Be thorough, be meticulous, be complete. Your reputation depends on finding ALL errors.
- Remember: Professional documents require PERFECT proofreading.
